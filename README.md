This is my code using CNN and Resnet to run Mnist Dataset(in the folder **mnist** or download [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)) with pytorch. <br> 
Before running **mycnn.py**(CPU version)/**mycnn_cuda.py**(CPU and GPU version)/**myresnet.py** for model training, you have to run data.py for data preprocessing first.

-------------------------
This code was tested on a MacOS 10.15.1 system using Pytorch version 1.1.0.post2.<br>
For more information about running the code on slurm, you may refer to **SLU.sh**.
