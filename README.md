This is my code using CNN to run Mnist Dataset(in the folder **mnist** or download [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)) with pytorch. <br> 
Before running mycnn.py for model training, you have to run data.py for data preprocessing.

-------------------------
This code was tested on a MacOS 10.15.1 system using Pytorch version 1.1.0.post2.
